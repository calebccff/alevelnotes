# Making a weather balloon with a Raspberry Pi 

## Producing an accurate model
### **Factor that must be accounted for**
* Mass of objects to lift
* Volume of helium to use
  * Density of helium
  * Pressure of helium
  * Temperature (Affects pressure)
* Air
  * Pressure
  * Density
  * Temperature


```
NOTE to Andrew:
You don't need to include the volume of the Pi rig when calculating the bouyancy force as only the volume of the balloon is relevant
