# Physical quantities and units
* A physical quntitiy is what is being measured (e.g length, time, speed)
* A unit is how each quantity is measured (e.g meters, seconds)

The scientific community developed an international standard to make data easily accessible to other countries, the SI unit system (SystÃ©me International).
## Quantities and units
| Physical Quantity   | Quantity Symbol | SI Unit   | Unit Symbol |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| length              | l,d,x,s         | meter     | m           |
| time                | t               | second    | s           |
| mass                | m               | kilograms | kg          |
| electrical current  | I               | Ampere's  | A           |
| Temperature         | T,$\theta$      | Kelvin    | K           |
| Amount of substance | n               | moles     | mol         |
| Luminous intensity  | Iv              | candela   | cd          |

All other quantities can be expressed in these SI units.
### Examples:
>**Speed is the rate of change of distance:**
>$$
>\text{speed}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}
>$$
>Therefore it has the units $ms^{-1}$.

>**Kinetic energy**
>$$
>E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
>$$
>Or in terms of units
>$$
>\text{J} \to \text{kg}\times(\text{ms}^{-1})^2
>$$
>$$
>\text{J} \to \text{kgm}^2\text{s}^{-2}
>$$
>This is the unit for kinetic energy in it's base units, $1\,\text{J}$ of energy is $1\,\text{kgm}^2\text{s}^{-2}$

Units can be helpful in an exam to double check your working - if the units on each side match then it is *most likely* correct.
