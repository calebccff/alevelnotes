# Normal Distribution
* Half the data is on the left of the peak, half on the right
* Mean, median and mode are all the same value
* Can't find value $P(X=N)$ for any $N$ as you can't integrate to an absolute value
* Curve has points of inflection one standard deviation from the mean
  * This means the curve changes concavity
* __Standard Deviations__:
  * $1\times\sigma$ = 68% of the data
  * $2\times\sigma$ = 95% of the data
  * $3\times\sigma$ = 99.7% of the data

## Syntax
$X \sim B(n,p)$
$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
$\mu$ represents the center
$\sigma$ represents one standard deviation
